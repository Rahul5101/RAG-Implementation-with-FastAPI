# RAG-Implementation-with-FastAPI
In this project we makeing the multiple endpoints using FastAPI. In first endpoints we are uploading the documents and store in a local file system. In second endpoint we are finding the metadatas obtained from the uploaded pdfs and documents and In third endpoint I implement the RAG based question answer session in which we can asked any question, it convert this question into embedding using sentence tranformer and find the similar context from the local databased where the all document embedding has been stored and then we give the entire context and question to the llm and llm give the proper answer.
